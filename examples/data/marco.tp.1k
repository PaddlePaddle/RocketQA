-	The geocentric model, also known as the Ptolemaic system, is a theory that was developed by philosophers in Ancient Greece and was named after the philosopher Claudius Ptolemy who lived circa 90 to 168 A.D. It was developed to explain how the planets, the Sun, and even the stars orbit around the Earth. The geocentric theory has existed even before Ptolemy though. This model has been described in various early Greek manuscripts, and as early as the 4th century B.C.

Geocentric model	In the 4th century BC, two influential Greek philosophers, Plato and his student Aristotle, wrote works based on the geocentric model. According to Plato, the Earth was a sphere, stationary at the center of the universe.
Who developed the ideas that contradicted Ptolemy's geocentric model of the universe	The geocentric model was challenged by the heliocentric model (which claimed that the Sun, not Earth, was at the centre of the Universe). This model was developed by Nicoaus Copernicus, and defended fiercely by Galileo. This question is archived.
Geocentric system	Geocentric system, any theory of the structure of the solar system (or the universe) in which Earth is assumed to be at the centre of all. The most highly developed geocentric system was that of Ptolemy of Alexandria (2nd century ce). It was generally accepted until the 16th century, after which it was superseded by heliocentric models such as that of Nicolaus Copernicus.

Geocentric theory	Ptolemy's system. Ptolemy invented the most elaborated geocentric system, allowing the planets not only to move on circles around the earth, but using epicycles. By adding further ideas, he was able to predict the motion of the planets quite well.
Heliocentrism	The non-geocentric model of the Universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC). According to Philolaus, there was at the center of the Universe a central fire around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.
The Geocentric Model	Our knowledge of the Greekâs Geocentric model comes mostly from the Almagest, which is a book written by Claudius Ptolemy about 500 years after Aristotleâs lifetime. In the Almagest, Ptolemy included tables with the positions of the planets as predicted by his model.

Geocentric theory	A Geocentric theory is an astronomical theory which describes the universe as a Geocentric system, i.e., a system which puts the Earth in the center of the universe, and describes other objects from the point of view of the Earth.
Geocentric theory	Rendition of a geocentric system from the Middle Ages. A Geocentric theory is an astronomical theory which describes the universe as a Geocentric system, i.e., a system which puts the Earth in the center of the universe, and describes other objects from the point of view of the Earth.
-	Geocentric theory was the first explanation of the solar system  that completely explained and predicted the apparent motions of the  planets. The church also embraced this â¦theory and defended it  against the heliocentric theory. 4 people found this useful.
The Geocentric Model of the Solar System	In the 4th Century BC, Plato, and his student Aristotle, wrote a number of important treatises about the Geocentric Model of the Solar System. According to Plato, the Earth was a stationary sphere at the centre of the universe.
-	The geocentric theory reached its pinnacle with the system devised by Ptolemy. Ptolemy's geocentric theory continued to be the system of choice as the Roman empire succeeded that of the Greeks. With the fall of the Roman empire (circa 450 AD), it was left to the Arabs to keep the Ptolemaic view of the universe alive.ventually, with the re-emergence of European learning in the 13th century, the geocentric view of the universe would be adopted by the Catholic church. It is interesting that in the early European universities, Ptolemy's theory was relegated to the world of mathematics, calendars, and astrology.
Heliocentrism	The non-geocentric model of the Universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC). According to Philolaus, there was at the center of the Universe a central fire around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.n such systems the origin in the center of mass of the Earth, of the EarthâMoon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire solar system can be selected; see center-of-mass frame.
Heliocentrism	The non-geocentric model of the Universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC). According to Philolaus, there was at the center of the Universe a central fire around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.n the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus 's De revolutionibus presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy 's Almagest had presented his geocentric model in the 2nd century.
Who proposed the heliocentric model of your solar system?	The Heliocentric Theory was first thought of by Aristarchus of Samos. Heliocentrism is the proposal that the Sun is the center of the Solar System. This opposed the notion of Geocentricism, which suggested that the Earth was the center of the Solar System.

-	The geocentric theory was the model that the earth is at the center of the universe, and everything (sun, stars,moon,ect.) revolve around it daily.It was disproven about 500 â¦ years ago by Copernipus in favor of the heliocentric model which said that the earth went around the sun. 30 people found this useful.he heliocentric model places the Sun at the center of a Solar System with planets travelling around it in circular orbits, at increasing distances. It replaced the earlier Ptolomic model which had been handed down from Ancient Greek and Islamic astronomers.
Geocentric model	In astronomy, the Geocentric model (also known as Geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system) is a superseded description of the universe with the Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all circled Earth. The geocentric model served as the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Two observations supported the idea that the Earth was the center of the Universe.
-	Geocentric model. The geocentric model of the cosmos is a paradigm which places the Earth at the center of the universe. Common in ancient Greece, it was believed by both Aristotle and Ptolemy.Most Greeks assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets orbit Earth.Similar ideas were held in ancient China.he geocentric model was gradually replaced by the heliocentric model of Copernicus and Galileo due to the simplicity and predictive accuracy of that newer model. In this model, a set of fifty-five concentric crystalline spheres were considered to hold the Sun, the planets, and the stars.

-	After 1,400 years, Copernicus was the first to propose a theory which differed from Ptolemy's geocentric system, according to which the earth is at rest in the center with the rest of the planets revolving around it.
-	The Fall of the Geocentric Theory, and the Rise of Heliocentrism. The geocentric theory reached its pinnacle with the system devised by Ptolemy. Ptolemy's geocentric theory continued to be the system of choice as the Roman empire succeeded that of the Greeks. With the fall of the Roman empire (circa 450 AD), it was left to the Arabs to keep the Ptolemaic view of the universe alive.
Heliocentric Theory: Definition & Model	The first development of a heliocentric theory came from Aristarchus of Samos around 270 BCE. Aristarchus calculated the size of the earth and the distance to the Sun and determined that the Sun was much larger than the earth.
Geocentric model	Hicetas and Ecphantus, two Pythagoreans of the 5th century BC, and Heraclides Ponticus in the 4th century BC, believed that the Earth rotated on its axis but remained at the center of the universe. Such a system still qualifies as geocentric.
The Geocentric Model of the Solar System	Around the same time, another Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, wrote a treatise arguing for a heliocentric model of the Solar System. However, his theories were not widely accepted and no copies of his writing have survived. Geocentrism would not be seriously challenged until the 16th Century.
-	The heliocentric theory, on the other hand, states that the earth revolves around the Sun. The first advocate of a heliocentric model was Aristarchus of Samos in ancient Greece. Centuries later, Nicholaus Copernicus developed a geometric model of the heliocentric theory during the Renaissance.

Who developed ideas that contradiced Ptolemys geocentric model of the universe?	Answer   Ptolemy's research in the field of astronomy led him to continue down the vein of other Greek scholars who believed in the Geocentric system of planetary orbit.
The Geocentric Model of the Solar System	The Geocentric Model of the Solar System. http://astronomyhistory.suite101.com/article.cfm/the-geocentric-model-of-the-solar-system. An Introduction to Ptolemaic Astronomy. Geocentrism is an astronomical theory, central to the astronomy of Ancient Greece that posits that the Earth lies at the centre of the universe. The Geocentric model of the Solar System entered Greek astronomy sometime in the 6th Century BC in the writings of the astronomer Anaximander.
-	The theory of plate tectonics and continental drift were proposed at the beginning of the last century by a German scientist, Alfred Wegener. Before his time it was believed that the planet's features, such as mountains, were caused by the crust shrinking as the Earth cooled after it was formed.
Copernican Revolution	The geocentric theory or model was the belief that the Earth was the center of the universe and the Sun and stars revolved around it. Copernicus then introduced the heliocentrâ¦ic model with the Sun at the center. Making the world better, one answer at a time.
-	While radically different from Ptolemy's model, Copernicus's heliocentric theory was hardly an original idea. Similar theories had been proposed by Aristarchus as early as the third century B. C., and Nicholas de Cusa, a German scholar, had independently made the same assertion in a book he published in 1440.
Heliocentrism	While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in Pythagoreanism, and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the geocentric model described in Ptolemy's Almagest.
Geocentric model	Ancient Roman and medieval philosophers usually combined the geocentric model with a spherical Earth. It is not the same as the older flat Earth model implied in some mythology, as was the case with the biblical and postbiblical Latin cosmology.

-	Around 140 A.D. Ptolemy proposed his refined geocentric model. In the Ptolemaic universe, a planet moves in a small circle called an epicycle, and the center of the epicycle moves along a larger circle around the Earth.
Who was the first person to propose the heliocentric theory?	Answer by Joshuaalexanderjohnson. Confidence votes 26. The Heliocentric theory was first proposed about 2300 years ago, by Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 BC). *Some argue that it was the Polish-German astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), but his hypothesis was dated about 1800 years later.

probability	Part of the Mathematics glossary: Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of a given event's occurrence, which is expressed as a number between 1 and 0.
-	Probability is closely related to biological organization and adaptation to the environment. Living systems need to maintain their organizational order by producing specific internal events non-randomly, and must cope with the uncertain environments. These processes involve increases in the probability of favorable events for these systems by reducing the degree of uncertainty of events.
Probability	Definition of Probability. Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood of occurrence of an event. The value of probability lies between 0 and 1. If all outcomes of an experiment are equally likely, then the probability is given by, Probability of an event =.
Probability theory	Probability theory. Probability theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena. The outcome of a random event cannot be determined before it occurs, but it may be any one of several possible outcomes. The actual outcome is considered to be determined by chance.
Elvis Presley	Probability is a branch of mathematics which intrudes on everyday conversation. perhaps more than any other (except for just plain arithmetic and counting). A TV. weather report might announce that âthere is a 70% chance of rain today.â When you. hear that statement you automatically infer that there must be a 30% chance that it will.
Probability	A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one, with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results (in our example, the event {1,2,3,4,5,6}) is assigned a value of one.
-	In this article, first, a brief review of how biology is related to probability is offered, and then the major philosophical theories of probability are reviewed (e.g., Gillies, 2000; Galavotti, 2005) that are relevant to science, in order to assess their adequacy for the analysis of biological adaptations.
Probability	Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where, loosely speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur.
-	probability definition. A number between zero and one that shows how likely a certain event is. Usually, probability is expressed as a ratio: the number of experimental results that would produce the event divided by the number of experimental results considered possible. Thus, the probability of drawing the ten of clubs from an ordinary deck of cards is one in fifty-two (1:52), or one fifty-second.
Probability	Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty). The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin.
-	The focus of this aspect of probability in life is on a system's tendency to relate itself to its environment appropriately. The probability of survival to a certain reproductive age is strongly related to the fitness concept in Darwin's theory of natural selection (Mills and Beatty, 1979; Sober, 2000).
Classical Probability: Definition, Approach & Examples	Probability is a statistical concept that measures the likelihood of something happening. Classical probability is the statistical concept that measures the likelihood of something happening, but in a classic sense, it also means that every statistical experiment will contain elements that are equally likely to happen.
probability	(prÅbâ²É-bÄ­lâ²Ä­-tÄ) A number expressing the likelihood of the occurrence of a given event, especially a fraction expressing how many times the event will happen in a given number of tests or experiments. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the probability of rolling a particular side is 1 in 6, or 1/6 . Noun. 1. 2.
Why is probability useful in biology?	Also, if one looks at the probability of random mutation of a single point, one can estimate the conversion of one genotype to another (assuming the point mutation is not lethal and the protein product cannot form correctly). <br /><br /> In other words, it is essential in a variety of ways in Biology.
CHAPTER 1	Definition of probability. â¢â¢ Probability â is a measure or estimation of how likely it is that something will. happen or that a statement is true. Probabilities are given a value between 0 and 1. (0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen). The higher the. degree of probability, the more likely the event is to happen.
PROBABILITY THEORY	MAIN CONCEPTS. Probability is a name assigned to the relative frequency of an event in an event space, that is, a set of possible events. For example, we might define the event space as the two sides of a single coin labeled heads (H) and tails (T): {T, H}.
probability	Probability is defined as the likelihood of something occurring or the chance of something happening. 1  When there is a 50 percent chance of something, this is an example of a time when the event has a probability of 50 percent. 2  When there are gray clouds in the sky, this is an example of a time when there is a high probability of rain.

Probability	Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
Probability	The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
Basic Principles of Probability	Basic Principles of Probability. Definitions. Probability is a measure of how likely it is (or how probable it is) that a given event will occur. The more likely an event is, the higher its probability. The sample space is the set of possible outcomes within a given context. The sample space is equivalent to the universal set.
Probability interpretations	Propensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome. This kind of objective probability is sometimes called 'chance'.
Basic Concepts of Probability	The Role of Probability. Basic Concepts of Probability. A probability is a number that reflects the chance or likelihood that a particular event will occur. Probabilities can be expressed as proportions that range from 0 to 1, and they can also be expressed as percentages ranging from 0% to 100%.

Probability	Probability. How likely something is to happen. Many events can't be predicted with total certainty. The best we can say is how likely they are to happen, using the idea of probability. Tossing a Coin. When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or ; tails (T) We say that the probability of the coin landing H is Â½
How is probability related to genetics?	Probability and genetics go hand in hand. Mendel in his charts showed the probability of dominant and recessive genes being passed on to offspring. The desired trait could be cultivated knowing the probability of inheritance. Probability and genetics go hand in hand.

Tricuspid atresia	Tricuspid atresia. Definition. Tricuspid atresia is a type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital heart disease), in which the tricuspid heart valve is missing or abnormally developed. The defect blocks blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle.
Overview	Definition. Tricuspid atresia is a heart defect present at birth (congenital) in which one of the valves (tricuspid valve) between two of the heart's chambers â the upper right chamber (right atrium) and the lower right chamber (right ventricle) â isn't formed.efinition.

Tricuspid Atresia	What Is Tricuspid Atresia? Tricuspid atresia is a condition seen in newborns in which theyâre born without an important part of the heart called âthe tricuspid valve.â This valve plays a part in the heartâs essential function, which is to pump blood between the lungs and body.

Tricuspid atresia	| Symptoms | Diagnosis | Treatment | Postoperative care | Home care | Long-term outlook. Tricuspid atresia (TA) is a congenital (present at birth) heart defect that occurs due to abnormal development of the fetal heart during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.The tricuspid valve, normally located between the right atrium and the right ventricle, does not develop properly during pregnancy.n tricuspid atresia, however, the following occurs: 1  Improper development of the tricuspid valve prevents oxygen-poor (blue) blood from passing from the right atrium to the right ventricle and on to the lungs as it should. 2  The right ventricle is also underdeveloped.
Tricuspid Atresia	In some newborns, the tricuspid valve is missing or hasnât properly developed. Tricuspid atresia is a rare heart disorder thatâs congenital, or present at birth. Itâs a serious condition, and it can be life-threatening.
Tricuspid Atresia	Tricuspid atresia occurs when the tricuspid valve fails to develop while the baby is in the womb. This problem is quite rare, affecting 1 in 15,000 births, and it occurs equally in boys and girls. In the normal heart, the tricuspid valve is located on the heartâs right side between the atria (the upper chamber) and the ventricle (the lower chamber). In babies born with tricuspid atresia, the tricuspid valve is absent (1) and the right ventricle is small (2). In about 25% of babies, the position of the great arteries is also reversed. In some babies, there is also a severe narrowing at the pulmonary valve (3), or there can be complete absence of the pulmonary valve. In all babies with tricuspid atresia, there is no direct pathway for blue blood returning from the body to get to the lungs to pick up oxygen.
-	Common symptoms associated with tricuspid atresia include: 1  rapid breathing. 2  shortness of breath, or dyspnea. 3  a bluish skin color, or cyanosis.  fatigue that occurs during 1  feeding. slow growth.  sweating.
Single Ventricle Defects	Tricuspid Atresia - There is no tricuspid valve in the heart so blood cannot flow from the body into the heart in the normal way. The blood is not being properly refilled with oxygen so it does not complete the normal cycle of body -heart âlungs- heart - body.
Overview	Tricuspid atresia symptoms become evident soon after birth, and can include: 1  Blue tinge to the skin and lips (cyanosis) 2  Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) 3  Tiring easily, especially during feedings.  Slow growth and poor weight gain.

Pediatric Tricuspid Atresia Clinical Presentation	Symptoms of tricuspid atresia manifest early in life. Nearly one half of patients have symptoms on first day of life, and 80% are symptomatic by the first month of life. The clinical features largely depend on the magnitude of pulmonary blood flow.
pulmonary atresia	pulmonary atresia. a congenital heart defect of the right ventricular outflow tract. One form consists of an intact ventricular septum with an interatrial communication and a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. A more extreme form is the four-defect tetralogy of Fallot.
Tricuspid Atresia	In a baby with tricuspid atresia with severe pulmonary narrowing, closure of the ductus arteriosus removes the babyâs means of getting blood to the lungs and can result in very low oxygen levels. In this case a medicine called prostaglandin is given to keep the ductus arteriosus from closing.

Most of the DNA is located in the nucleus, although a small amount can be found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA). Within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes.
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)	In organisms called eukaryotes, DNA is found inside a special area of the cell called the nucleus. Because the cell is very small, and because organisms have many DNA molecules per cell, each DNA molecule must be tightly packaged. This packaged form of the DNA is called a chromosome. During DNA replication, DNA unwinds so it can be copied.
Be Part of Ask A Biologist	It is the largest organelle in the cell and it contains the DNA of the cell. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) contains all the information for cells to live, perform their functions and reproduce. Inside the nucleus is another organelle called the nucleolus. The nucleolus is responsible for making ribosomes. The circles on the surface of the nucleus are the nuclear pores. These are where ribosomes, and other materials move in and out of the cell.
Cell (biology)	1 Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. 2  The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. 3  Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids, which are usually circular.
What is DNA made of?	DNA is made of the nitrogen basses cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine, phasphates, the sugar deoxyribose, and is all held together by hydrogen bonds.
Inside the Cell	Inside the cell nucleus, where your DNA is safely packaged in chromosomes, are miniature protein machines called RNA polymerases. Composed of a dozen different small proteins, these molecular machines first pull apart the two strands of stringy DNA, then transcribe the DNA into a closely related molecule called RNA.
Contents: DNA vs RNA	DNA is found in the nucleus of a cell (nuclear DNA) and in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA). It has two nucleotide strands which consist of its phosphate group, five-carbon sugar (the stable 2-deoxyribose), and four nitrogen-containing nucleobases: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.
-	A: In eukaryotic organisms, the majority of DNA is found within the nucleus of the cell in the form of a chain of chromosomes. Eukaryotes also have extra chromosomal DNA that is found within various cell organelles located outside of the nucleus, primarily in the mitochondria and chloroplasts.
-	DNA, is a genetic material present inside the nucleus which has the information that helps in the synthesis of RNA and proteins. They have information which help in the formation of mRNA that specifies a particular protein product. mRNA acts as a template translating DNA code into specific protein.
-	Most DNA is found in the nucleus of a cell, but some extranuclear DNA exists in human mitochondria, which are cellular organelles that create energy for the cell.
DNA	DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms. This includes animals, plants, protists, archaea and bacteria. DNA is in each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make.Mostly, these proteins are enzymes.DNA is inherited by children from their parents. This is why children share traits with their parents, such as skin, hair and eye color.roteins are made by tiny machines in the cell called ribosomes. Ribosomes are in the main body of the cell, but DNA is only in the nucleus of the cell. The codon is part of the DNA, but DNA never leaves the nucleus.
-	The largest and most clearly visible of the cell's constituents is the nucleus. Within the nucleus, DNA molecules, the cell's genetic machinery, are stored, repaired, transcribed and eventually replicated.Around the outside of the nucleus is an envelope consisting of two layers of membrane.he largest and most clearly visible of the cell's constituents is the nucleus. Within the nucleus, DNA molecules, the cell's genetic machinery, are stored, repaired, transcribed and eventually replicated.
